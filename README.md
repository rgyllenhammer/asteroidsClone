# asteroidsClone
a clone of the classic asteroids game i am making with python and pygame

this is a work in progress that i am saving 5 minutes here or there to add to. 
i will update this readme and the files periodically with what i have just added

current version: asteroids are non - interactable when they are green which allows player to move out of the way of them 
when they spawn... you also cannot shoot them when they are green
